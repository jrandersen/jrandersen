## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about using technology to transform how we design and build, creating structures that are better for both people and the planet. With over a decade of experience applying tech solutions to construction challenges, I've led teams during WeWork's global expansion and guided startups through strategic pivots.
I'm particularly excited about modular fabrication, sustainable design, and making construction more fun and environmentally responsible through technology.
